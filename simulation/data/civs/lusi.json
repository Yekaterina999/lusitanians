					"History": "Viriato, like Vercingetorix amongst the Gauls, was the most famous of the Iberian tribal war leaders, having conducted at least 7 campaigns against the Romans in the southern half of the peninsula during the 'Lusitani Wars' from 147-139 B.C. He surfaced as a survivor of the treacherous massacre of 9,000 men and the selling into slavery of 21,000 elderly, women, and children of the Lusitani. They had signed a treaty of peace with the Romans, conducted by Servius Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hispania Ulterior, as the 'final solution' to the Lusitani problem. He emerged from humble beginnings in 151 B.C. to become war chief of the Lusitani. He was intelligent and a superior tactician, never really defeated in any encounter (though suffered losses in some requiring retreat). He succumbed instead to another treachery arranged by a later Roman commander, Q. Servilius Caepio, to have him assassinated by three comrades that were close to him."
